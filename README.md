# toi15_cave
This problem is from Thailand Olympiad in Informatics 15th (TOI15th)
It is about the avengers want to help people in the cave.
In the cave, there are N nodes and M edges.(1<=N<=2000,1<=M<=10000)
Each edge has value u[i],v[i],w[i].(1<=u[i],v[i]<=2000,1<=w[i]<=1000000000)
u[i] and v[i] mean you can travel from u[i] to v[i].(It is directed graph,so you can't travel from v[i] to u[i].)
w[i] is value of an edge.
There are Q situations . (1<=Q<=500000)
Each situation has a value h[i].(1<=h[i]<=1000000)
each h[i] means all edges are increased by h[i] except the edges which are adjancent to the entrance of the cave.
The question : In is situation, What is the shortest way to help people in the cave?
